# First portfolio website

# What is it?
A website made to display different projects and a way to contact the owner.

# What I've learned?
+ Learned how to use Adobe XD for the creation of the prototype.
+ How to use the CSS grid display property.
+ How to use SASS for the development of the style of the website.
+ How to use Gulp to automate some repetitive tasks.
+ Learned how to use jQuery.

# Encountered challanges
+ Making the image from the projects section adapt to the window screen while not loosing the original square shape. This was solved by creating a container for the image, where the position of the container was kept relative allowing the image to adjust its size depending of the container. The image position was set to absolute, the height was set to auto to adjust to the width which was set to 100%.
